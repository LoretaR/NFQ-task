# NFQ-task
The work creates two folders, the main public and source. The index file contains the main code, which is also displayed to the user. Connected two database tables, Projects and Students. On the main page we display the most recently created project with the entered data, to create a new project it can be added with a button at the top of the page. The list of students is taken from the database, the student can be added with the button and deleted by selecting Action Delete. Group tables are created automatically after taking the data from the last project, we select the students from the databese table Students,  adding Javascript code to eliminate the already selected students.
In the source file we have two connections to the database by adding projects and students, a connection to the database and a student delete function. I could' not to accomplish to include the selected student group in the student table.
